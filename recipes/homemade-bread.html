  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>A simple recipe to create two, delicious loaves of bread without having to go to the store. Loaves will last up to five days in a closed 
        container, or can be frozen for up to two months.
    </em></p>

    

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> warm water (105-115 degrees)</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tablespoon</strong> active dry yeast</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> honey or sugar</li>
        <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tablespoons</strong> canola or vegetable oil</li>
        <li><strong>4 - 5 1/2 cups</strong> all-purpose or bread flour</li>
    
    </ul>

    

  <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare the dough: </strong> 
            Add water, yeast, and a pinch of sugar or honey
            to a large bowl. Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes until foaming and bubbly.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Add remaining sugar or honey, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour
            Mix until combined.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Add another cup of flour and mix to combine. With the mixer running add more flour,
            1/2 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. 
            The dough should be smooth and elastic, and slightly stick to a clean finger, but not be overly sticky. 
            Add a little more flour, if needed.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Knead the dough: </strong>
            Mix the dough for 4-5 minutes on medium speed (or knead with your hands on a lightly floured surface, for 5-8 minutes).
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>First Rise: </strong>Grease a large bowl with oil or cooking spray and place the dough inside, turning to coat.
            Cover with a dish towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place* until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Spray two 9x5'' bread pans generously with cooking spray on all sides. (I also like to line the bottom of the pans with a 
            small piece of parchment or wax paper, but this is optional.)
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Punch the dough down well to remove air bubbles. Divide into two equal portions. Shape each ball into long logs and 
            place into greased loaf pans.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Second Rise: </strong>Spray two pieces of plastic wrap with cooking spray and lay them gently over the pans. 
            Allow dough to rise again for about 45 minutes to one hour, or until risen about 1 inch above the loaf pans. 
            Gently removing covering.
        </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Bake: </strong>Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake bread for about 30-33 minutes, or until golden brown on top. 
            Give the top of a loaf a gentle tap; it should sound hollow.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Invert the loaves onto a wire cooling rack. Brush the tops with butter and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
        </p></li>
